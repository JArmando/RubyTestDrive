# Ruby Test Drive #
## BlogApp ##
### Description ###
This project is my first attempt at programming using **Ruby**. With it I managed create an app that can read from a **Json** file and parse its content to emulate a Post which gets served through an **API**


### Technologies used ###
- Ruby
- Sinatra
- Minitest
- Bundler
- AngularJs
- Grunt
- Bower
- Bootstrap

## Getting  Started ##
### (Preparing) The Code ###
You'll need [NodeJS.](http://nodejs.org) With it at hand you only need to clone
this [repository](https://bitbucket.org/MobiusLab/rubytestdrive) and follow my lead:

- Open a console and get to:
    cd path/to/clone/directory

- Run these statements on the console to get **javascript** dependencies:
    
    npm install

    bower install

    grunt

- Run these statements on the console to get **Ruby** ***gems*** dependencies:

    gem install bundler

    bundle install
